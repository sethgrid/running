At its discretion, 300 Days Inc. may offer additional website Services and/or products, or update, modify or revise any current content and Services, and this Agreement shall apply to any and all additional Services and/or products and any and all updated, modified or revised Services unless otherwise stipulated. 300 Days Inc. does hereby reserve the right to cancel and cease offering any of the aforementioned Services and/or products.
